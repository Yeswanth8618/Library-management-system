The Well-Grounded Rubyist takes you from interested novice to proficient practitioner. It's a beautifully written tutorial that begins with the basic steps to get your first Ruby program up and running and goes on to explore sophisticated topics like callable objects, reflection, and threading The book concentrates on the language, preparing you for any way you may choose to use Ruby. Whether the topic is simple or tough, the book's easy-to-follow examples and explanations give you immediate conidence as you build your Ruby programming skills.    The Well-Grounded Rubyist is a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the best-selling Ruby for Rails. In this new book, expert author Daid A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view of Ruby. It covers Ruby 1.9, and keeps the same sharp focus and clear writing that made Ruby for Rails stand out.    It's no wonder one reader commented: \"The technical depth is just right to not distract beginners, yet detailed enough for more advanced readers.\"",

      "longDescription": "Microsoft describes Silverlight as a \"cross-browser, cross-platform plug-in for delivering the next generation of .NET based media experiences and rich interactive applications for the Web.\" That's a really boring description for a really exciting new technology. Anyone who has looked at the demos and gotten a taste of what Silverlight can do knows that Silverlight represents an entirely new level of rich web interface technology for Microsoft developers. With Silverlight 2, developers can use JavaScript, VB, C#, Python, and Ruby to build user-friendly, interactive, and visually-dazzling web applications that work in most major browsers.    Silverlight 2 in Action is the first book to cover Silverlight 2, a far more robust implementation of Silverlight than the current 1 release that supports only JavaScript. The much-anticipated 2 release adds powerful new features along with the ability to code in multiple languages and integrate your work with Visual Studio and the new Expression suite of tools. This book delivers real-world examples and in-depth walkthroughs to help you conidently enhance your web applications using Silverlight 2.    Silverlight 2 in Action devotes extensive coverage to flexible layout components, the extensible control model, the communication framework, and the data-binding features   all cornerstones of software development. Author and Microsoft MVP Chad Campbell also describes rich media and viid graphical and animation features. The final chapters include a variety of Silverlight deployment scenarios.    In addition to the fundamentals of Silverlight, you'll be introduced to architectural components such as the Silverlight object model. The book addresses the developer/designer collaboration model Silverlight enables, showing the developer how to include the designer effectively in the project workflow. This model is illustrated throughout the examples.    For ongoing reader support, the author will maintain a dedicated book-support website proiding up-to-the-minute working examples, complete with source code, all in Silverlight.",

SQL Server 2008 Administration in Action focuses the production DBA, digging deep into the various tasks specific to that role. Expert author Rod Colledge--check him out at sqlCrunch.com--teaches you best practices that cover the lifecycle of a SQL Server system, including infrastructure design, installation, and operational maintenance. And while many of these techniques will work in any recent version of SQL Server, you'll find full coverage of emerging SQL Server 2008 best practices.    Each technique is presented in a task-driven style, and in the order of the typical life cycle of a SQL Server system.

Many computing tasks require taking data from one computer system, manipulating it in some way, and passing it to another. Munging can mean manipulating raw data to achieve a final form. It can mean parsing or filtering data, or the many steps required for data recognition. Or it can be something as simple as converting hours worked plus pay rates into a salary cheque.    This book shows you how to process data productively with Perl. It discusses general munging techniques and how to think about data munging problems. You will learn how to decouple the various stages of munging programs, how to design data structures, how to emulate the Unix filter model, etc. If you need to work with complex data formats it will teach you how to do that and also how to build your own tools to process these formats. The book includes detailed techniques for processing HTML and XML. And, it shows you how to build your own parsers to process data of arbitrary complexity.    If you are a programmer who munges data, this book will save you time. It will teach you systematic and powerful techniques using Perl. If you are not a Perl programmer, this book may just convince you to add Perl to your repertoire.",

In addition, you'll learn to layout your pages with the new flexible box and layout modules, and add the finishing touches with custom fonts. You'll also see how to target specific devices with media queries, and do all of it with less code thanks to the new selectors and pseudo classes.    Finally you will walk through several large examples where you see all the features of HTML5 and CSS3 working together to produce responsive and lightweight applications which you can interact with just like native desktop apps.",

      "shortDescription": "Seam in Action goes into great detail on the ways in which Seam helps reduce the burden of integration with different technologies such as Hibernate and JSF, allowing the developer to focus on the core business objective at hand.       Shobana Jayaraman, Digital Infrastructure Analyst, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Library, The Tech Static",
      "longDescription": "Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is raidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outide the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn't just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.",

      "longDescription": "Service Oriented Architecture, or SOA, has become embraced by many organizations as a means of improving reusability of software assets; proiding better alignment between business and IT; and, increasing agility for responding to demands in the marketplace. This is accomplished by breaking indiidual units of functionality into services that can then be exposed through open protocols and standards.    Until recently, many of the software technologies used for developing SOA-based solutions were limited to expensive, commercial offerings. However, that has now changed, and a compelling open source SOA platform can be implemented exclusively with open source products. This bookidentifies a suite of open source products that can be used for a building SOA environment, and describes how they can be integrated by practitioners. It includes a hands-on introduction to the products selected; a multitude of source code examples; and implementation through real-life case studies.",

      "longDescription": "If you are interested in Python and Tkinter, you have probably noticed that although there is some good contributed documentation on the Web, there is not enough to get Tkinter applications up and running. Python and Tkinter Programming is the answer. It is designed for readers who are familiar with Python and who need to develop applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).    Python and Tkinter Programming presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion. Sample code illustrates each element. Complete applications that go far beyond the fill-the-form class of graphical user interfaces are presented; here you will find examples of complex controls, drawn interfaces and photorealistic panels. The code can readily be used as templates for new applications. Extensions to Python (such as ODBC) are examined as well. Complete source code for all examples, along with the latest releases of required software, will be available from Manning's web site.    Tkinter is fully documented. To date, this level of documentation has not been available to Tkinter programmers, who have been required to read the code or interpret Tcl/Tk man pages to fully understand component usage.    Python and Tkinter Programming will be useful in both Windows and Unix environments, and the example code is portable between the two environments.",

      "longDescription": "If you're a Java developer, you've almost certainly heard of OSGi   and also heard that it's becoming quite a big deal. But you may still be wondering exactly \"What is OSGi \"    Simply put, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format, called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with such approaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It's the backbone of Eclipse's plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on top of it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive gide to OSGi with two primary goals.    First, it proides a clear introduction to OSGi concepts with examples that are relevant both for architects and developers. The centralidea of OSGi is modularity, so you start by learning about OSGi bundles.    You'll then see how OSGi handles module lifecycles and follow up with how it promotes service-oriented interaction among application components.    With the core concepts well in hand, you'll explore numerous application scenarios and techniques. How much of OSGi do you actually need  How do you embed OSGi inide other containers  What are the best practices for migrating legacy systems to OSGi  How can you embrace and make the most of system dynamism     Expert authors Richard S. Hall, Karl Pauls, and Stuart McCulloch have years of experience both in building OSGi-based systems and in contributing to OSGi implementations such as Apache Felix.",

      "longDescription": "The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a new technology from Google that automatically translates Java into JavaScript, making Ajax applications easier to code and deploy. GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT idget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT idget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-ide components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You   ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create idgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: idgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.    You   ll cover:    Testing, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications  Communicating with GWT-RPC  Examining client-ide RPC architecture  Alternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel  Achieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  Making your GWT application flexible and supportable  GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.",

It first covers the core features of Python (syntax, control flow, basic data structures, etc.) and proides the knowledge to write basic but useful scripts. Features in Python common to other languages are covered very concisely, while features unique to Python are explained in detail.    It next discusses Python features which would be useful to anyone using Python in larger applications, including facilities for managing large collections of code, object-oriented programming, advanced string handling, etc.    The last section of the book discusses advanced topics: Windows/COM programming with Python, integrating Python and Java (Python is one of the few languages other than Java which can be compiled into Java bytecode), extending the Python language with C, and an introduction to some of the advanced web site building tools that are available for Python.",

      "longDescription": "When Lucene first hit the scene five years ago, it was nothing short of amazing. By using this open-source, highly scalable, super-fast search engine, developers could integrate search into applications quickly and efficiently. A lot has changed since then   search has grown from a \"nice-to-have\" feature into an indispensable part of most enterprise applications. Lucene now powers search in diverse companies including Akamai, Netflix, LinkedIn, Technorati, HotJobs, Epiphany, FedEx, Mayo Clinic, MIT, New Scientist Magazine, and many others.    Some things remain the same, though. Lucene still delivers high-performance search features in a disarmingly easy-to-use API. It's still a single compact JAR file (less than 1 MB!). Due to its vibrant and diverse open-source community of developers and users, Lucene is relentlessly improving, with evolutions to APIs, significant new features such as payloads, and a huge (as much as 8x) increase in indexing speed with Lucene 3.0.    And with clear writing, reusable examples, and unmatched advice on best practices, Lucene in Action is still the definitive gide to developing with Lucene.",

      "longDescription": "Cloud-based applications pose an intriguing value proposition for businesses. With an easily scalable, pay-as-you-go model and very small startup costs, the cloud can be a great alternative to systems hosted in-house. Developers are scrambling to understand the impact a cloud-based approach will have on current and future projects.    Azure is Microsoft's full-fledged entry into the \"Cloud Services Platform\" arena. Unlike other cloud offerings that address only one piece of the puzzle, Azure includes an operating system, a set of developer services, and a data model that can be used indiidually or together. It's designed to interact seamlessly with other .NET-based components, and leverages your knowledge of Visual Studio, the .NET platform, and SQL Server. It's also fully compatible with multiple internet protocols, including HTTP, REST, SOAP, and XML.    Azure in Action is a fast-paced tutorial intended for architects and developers looking to develop on Windows Azure and the Windows Azure Platform. It's designed both for readers new to cloud concepts and for those familiar with cloud development but new to Azure. After a quick walk through the basics, it gides you all the way from your first app through more advanced concepts of the Windows Azure Platform.    The book starts by looking at the logical and physical architecture of an Azure app, and then moves to the core storage services   binary store, tables and queues. Then, it explores designing and scaling frontend and backend services that run in the cloud. Next, it covers more advanced scenarios in Windows Azure. After covering the core of Azure, it introduces the rest of the Windows Azure Platform with a particular focus on SQL Azure Database.",

Portals help reduce complexity by allowing the dynamic aggregation and display of diverse content in a single web page. Portal components are pluggable parts called portlets. To be \"pluggable\" portlets and portals must satisfy standards. The authors of this book, all but one employees of IBM, created these standards: Java Portlet Specification JSR 168 and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP).    The book starts gently with the basics of portlet technology and a functionrich portlet example. It then dives more deeply into portlets and J2EE, portlet architecture, best practices, and explores how the popular JSF web framework can ease portlet development. It shows how to set up an open source portal and create portlets that dynamically access backend data of various types. It is rich in something readers want: code examples that show them how to do it.",

The book includes step-by-step instruction for building dozens of code generators of varying types. These generators build high-quality output that is consistent and maintainable. Code generation abstracts the design of the code so that multiple outputs can be created from a single model of the application functionality, which means development teams can focus on higher-level design work and strategic problems, while still meeting goals for maintaining production applications.. The book covers techniques that range from simple code processors that handle common coding problems to more elaborate and complex generators that maintain entire application tiers.  Code Generation In Action covers building database access, user interface, remote procedure, test cases, and business logic code as well as code for other key system functions.    Although code generation is an engineering technique it also has a large impact on the engineering team and management.

In response, agile processes and lightweight tooling have begun to replace traditional engineering processes throughout the development lifecycle. An agile approach to application lifecycle management improves product quality, reduces time to market, and makes for happier developers.    Agile ALM is a gide for Java developers who want to integrate flexible agile practices and lightweight tooling along all phases of the software development process. The book introduces a new vision for managing change in requirements and process more efficiently and flexibly. You'll learn powerful practices like task-based Development, where you align activities into tasks resulting in traceable artifacts, Continuous Integration, in which you frequently and systematically integrate, build, and test an application in development and using Scrum as an agile approach to release management. The effect is a more comprehensive and practical approach to build, configuration, deployment, release, test, quality, integration, and requirements management.    This book synthesizes technical and functional elements to proide a comprehensive approach to software development. You'll learn to see the whole scope of the development process as a set of defined tasks, many of which are repeated daily, and then master the tools and practices you need to accomplish each of those tasks efficiently.    Because efficient tool chains can radically improve the speed and flidity of the development process, this book demonstrates how to integrate state-of-the-art lightweight tools. Many of the tools and examples are Java-based, but the Agile ALM principles apply to all development platforms. As well, the many examples show how you can bidge different languages and systems.",

No transport  Camel proides a flexible pluggable architecture to build your own components. Or you can let Camel adapt to your existing libraries without the need to change anything.    Camel in Action is for developers working with integration of any kind. This highly practical book introduces Camel and shows examples of how to use it with the 45+ supported enterprise integration patterns. Written by the people who wrote the Camel code, it's up to date and distills details and insights that only people deeply involved with Camel could proide.    Camel is designed to run in any existing environment without imposing restrictions. This allows you to get started with Camel very easily and reuse existing infrastructure and platforms. Camel can run in many forms such as standalone, web or Spring application, JBI, OSGi, Java EE, in the cloud, and so on. The book includes a technical reference explaining how to use Camel with many platforms.",

      "longDescription": "Statistical data is only as valuable as your ability to analyze, interpret, and present it in a meaningful way. Gnuplot is the most idely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It's open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics.    So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you've never tried gnuplot   or have found it tough to get your arms around   read on.    Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot   from the basics to the power features and beyond. Beides proiding a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is pid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.    One of gnuplot's main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look \"just right\" by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.    Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots   powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.    Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn't have an education in analytical tools and methods. It's perfect for DBAs, programmers, and performance engineers; business analysts and MBAs; and Six-Sigma Black Belts and process engineers.",

Until now.    Elements of Programming with Perl is a general introduction to programming, using Perl as the implementation language. It starts at the beginning, teaching programming style, structure, and design. It covers all the fundamental elements of Perl (e.g., pattern matching and text processing) and proceeds to advanced concepts, including modular programming, abstract data structures, and object oriented programming.    Elements of Programming with Perl contains numerous examples and diagrams that illustrate concepts, algorithms and techniques. Complete example programs show the new programmer how to tie concepts together to solve real-world problems.

There are    thousands    of them   so many that it can be nearly impossible to keep track of all the locations and settings you need to administer Windows effectively. For administrators, PowerShell is a godsend because it proides a single, unified command line from which you can control and automate every aspect of Windows. PowerShell finally enables Windows administrators to work in a way that Unix and Linux administrators have leveraged for decades.    Like classic administrative shells, PowerShell accepts and immediately executes typed commands. In addition, it has all the features of a full-fledged programming language built in, so you can create scripts to automate even the most complex tasks. And it's fully aware of all the components of Windows and most Windows servers, so you can use PowerShell to control Exchange, IIS, SharePoint, and other core pieces of your Windows system.

It simplifies things: where standards usually discuss many possible variations of each security technique, this book focuses on the 20% of variations that are used 80% of the time.

Rather than maintaining parallel tracks, Merb 2 and Rails 3 will merge, preserving the flexible configuration and advanced features that Merb users love along with the raid productivity and ease-of-use that makes Rails shine. As Engine Yard developer (and Manning author) Yehuda Katz puts it, \"Effectively, Merb 2 is Rails 3.\"    Rails 3 in Action will proide a thorough introduction to Ruby-based web development using Rails. Like Rails 3 itself, this book combines Merb and Rails in the form of authors Yehuda Katz, Merb Lead Developer.    As a developer, you'll benefit from several big advantages to this change:  Rails becomes more modular, by building on rails core with the ability to opt in or out of specific components and making it possible to replace parts of Rails without disturbing other parts.  Merb performance improvements flow into Rails, including benchmarking applications so developers can see which optimizations have real-world impact.  A defined public API with a test suite, so users and plugin developers have a stable API to build against.  A \"core\" version of Rails, like Merb's current core generator, that makes it easy to select just the parts that are important for your app.  DataMapper and Sequel support as first-class ORMs, along with ActiveRecord as the default.  Rack support in Rails 3, to improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.  The Rails 3 team is moving full steam ahead building the new version. The Merb team will start working on Rails immediately, and also continue to fix bugs and resolve other major issues in the current release of Merb. Interim versions of Merb will help ease the transition to Rails 3. In particular, Merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms will assist developers in tracking down the changes between Merb 1.x and Rails 3.    If you've already learned Merb, Rails 3 in Action will help you parlay that knowledge into the new Rails code base. If you're a long time Rails developer, it will help you get up to speed with all the new Rails 3 features and changes.",

      "longDescription": "An engine of the world economy, the computer industry is sputtering. What happened  Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past     No.    That's the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.    This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.    A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an inider's view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.    In Technology Paradise Lost Keller describes how the new thinking is working inide some of the country's most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah's, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.    As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants' fees.    In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity. Counterintuitively, companies that spend less in order to get more from information technology will likely be the big winners.",

      "longDescription": "Laszlo in Action is the first comprehensive gide to the Laszlo system and its language LZX. OpenLaszlo is an increasingly popular open-source platform for the development and delivery of rich internet applications across multiple platforms: Flash, DHTML, and J2ME. The dramatic emergence of Ajax over the past year was a first step in the transition from page-oriented HTML web applications towards more full-featured rich internet applications. OpenLaszlo proides another important step in this continuing evolutionary process through the increased productivity resulting from LZX's declarative approach. It proides developers with the tools to create web-based applications offering the usability and interactivity associated with desktop applications, and the low costs associated with web-based deployment. The cross-platform nature of Laszlo LZX applications allows source code with only minimum modifications to run natively on all popular web browsers, on all desktop operating systems, on the Flash platform, and other platforms in the future.    Written to address the needs of a ide spectrum of developers, ranging from client-ide HTML and JavaScript developers all the way to enterprise-class Java or Rails engineers, this book proides a very hands-on approach towards building applications that solve real-world problems across both the Flash and DHTML platforms. Starting with the fundamentals of Laszlo LZX, the authors quickly move towards applying this knowledge to the design and development of a full-scale application called the Laszlo Market. This proides a working context to assist understanding the underlying concepts of Laszlo LZX and, more importantly, how to apply this knowledge in innovative ways. The construction of the Laszlo Market proceeds over the course of the book illustrating topics starting with an initial wireframe and storyboard design to optimization issues dealing with the application's deployment across the Flash and DHTML platforms.",

With examples in Java and the Java EE environment, it explores both the techniques and the mindset of TDD and ATDD. It uses carefully chosen examples to illustrate TDD tools and design patterns, not in the abstract but concretely in the context of the technologies you face at work.

As NHibernate is a port of Hibernate from Java to .NET, the book is based on Manning's bestselling Hibernate in Action.    NHibernate in Action begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application. The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic \"Hello World\" example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.    The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also proide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets. Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.",

      "longDescription": "A software system is the realization of a set of concerns. One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-ide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-ide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-ide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn.    AspectJ in Action is a practical gide to AOP and AspectJ. The reusable code examples that are proided will enable quick implementation of functionality in your system.    The book is diided into three parts. The first part introduces AOP and AspectJ and will be helpful to developers wanting to learn or advance their knowledge of AspectJ. The second and third parts present examples of everyday situations in which you can use simple and easy AspectJ solutions to implement common system requirements such as logging, policy enforcement, resource pooling, business rules, thread-safety, authentication and authorization, as well as transaction management.",

      "longDescription": "Hadoop is an open source framework implementing the MapReduce algorithm behind Google's approach to querying the distributed data sets that constitute the internet. This definition naturally leads to an obvious question, \"What are \"maps\" and why do they need to be \"reduced \"    Massive data sets can be extremely difficult to analyze and query using traditional mechanisms, especially when the queries themselves are quite complicated. In effect, the MapReduce algorithm breaks up both the query and the data set into constituent parts   that's the \"mapping.\" The mapped components of the query can be processed simultaneously   or \"reduced\"   to raidly return results.    Hadoop in Action teaches readers how to use Hadoop and write MapReduce programs. The intended readers are programmers, architects, and project managers who have to process large amounts of data offline. Hadoop in Action will lead the reader from obtaining a copy of Hadoop to setting it up in a cluster and writing data analytic programs.    The book begins by making the basicidea of Hadoop and MapReduce easier to grasp by applying the default Hadoop installation to a few easy-to-follow tasks, such as analyzing changes in word frequency across a body of documents. The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.    Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complexidea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.    This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java. Familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g. histogram, correlation) will help the reader appreciate the more advanced data processing examples.",

      "longDescription": "A software system is the realization of a set of concerns. One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-ide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-ide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-ide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn.    AspectJ in Action is a practical gide to AOP and AspectJ. The reusable code examples that are proided will enable quick implementation of functionality in your system.    The book is diided into three parts. The first part introduces AOP and AspectJ and will be helpful to developers wanting to learn or advance their knowledge of AspectJ. The second and third parts present examples of everyday situations in which you can use simple and easy AspectJ solutions to implement common system requirements such as logging, policy enforcement, resource pooling, business rules, thread-safety, authentication and authorization, as well as transaction management.",

Tapestry represents state and behavior as standard Java objects, methods and properties. That means state management and multithreading are handled by the framework, leaving you with just your application's business logic. Tapestry does more, you do less.    Tapestry in Action is the definitive gide to the Tapestry approach: creating full-featured web apps by connecting framework components to economical amounts of application code. Many simple examples show you how to tackle common tasks such as form vaidation, application localization, client-ide scripting, and synchronization between browser and app server. Later chapters discuss more advanced topics including creation of new components and integration with J2EE.

It also has its roots in a great many publications of the author, from trade and journal articles and book chapters to six earlier books.    Doing IT Right explores IT in its full complexity. It explains fundamental issues of hardware and software structures; it illuminates central issues of networking and encapsulates the essence of client/server computing; its coverage of costing, risk assessment, and due diligence in making computing decisions is unique; its presentation of the concepts and issues of object-orientation was conidered by the managers at an IBM development laboratory to be Unique and more informative than fifteen other OO presentations put together.",

LINQ in Action is a fast-paced, comprehensive tutorial for professional developers who want to use LINQ. This book explores what can be done with LINQ, shows you how it works in an application, and addresses the emerging best practices. It presents the general purpose query facilities offered by LINQ in the upcoming C# 3.0 and VB.NET 9.0 languages. A running example introduces basic LINQ concepts. You   ll then learn to query unstructured data using LINQ to XML and relational data with LINQ to SQL. Finally, you   ll see how to extend LINQ for custom applications.    LINQ in Action will gide you along as you navigate this new world of lambda expressions, query operators, and expression trees. You   ll also explore the new features of C# 3.0, VB.NET 9.0. The book is very practical, anchoring each newidea with running code.    You will discover all the basics needed to get a clear understanding of LINQ. Whether you want to use LINQ to query objects, XML documents, or relational databases, you will find all the information you need to get started.    But LINQ in Action does not stop at the basic code. This book also shows you how LINQ can be used for advanced processing of data. This includes coverage of LINQ   s extensibility, which allows querying more data sources than those supported by default.    All code samples are built on a concrete business case.

      "longDescription": "Web 2.0 applications are best known for proiding a rich user experience, but the parts you can't see are just as important   and impressive. Many Web 2.0 applications use powerful techniques to process information intelligently and offer features based on patterns and relationships in the data that couldn't be discovered manually. Successful examples of these Algorithms of the Intelligent Web include household names like Google Ad Sense, Netflix, and Amazon. These applications use the internet as a platform that not only gathers data at an ever-increasing pace but also systematically transforms the raw data into actionable information.    Algorithms of the Intelligent Web is an example-driven blueprint for creating applications that collect, analyze, and act on the massive quantities of data users leave in their wake as they use the web. You'll learn how to build Amazon- and Netflix-style recommendation engines, and how the same techniques apply to people matches on social-networking sites. See how click-trace analysis can result in smarter ad rotations. With a plethora of examples and extensive detail, this book shows you how to build Web 2.0 applications that are as smart as your users.",

New technologies and devices   not to mention higher user expectations   have greatly multiplied the complexity level of interface programming. Enter JavaFX.    JavaFX is a set of Java-based rich user interface technologies that sits atop the existing Java Standard and Micro Editions, making current Java packages readily accessible from the JavaFX environment. At its heart is JavaFX Script, an innovative, compiled, domain specific language. JavaFX Script boasts a declarative syntax where the code structure mirrors the structure of the interface. Related UI pieces are kept in one efficient bundle, not strewn across multiple locations. A simple coding model reduces code complexity while increasing productivity. The JavaFX-specific libraries for presentation and animation take advantage of JavaFX Script's unique language features.    JavaFX in Action is a hands-on tutorial that introduces and explores JavaFX through numerous bite-sized projects. The book proides a soid grounding in the JavaFX syntax and related APIs by showing you how to apply the key features of the JavaFX platform. You'll absorb the fundamentals of the technology while exploring the possibilities JavaFX open up for your designs.    Author Simon Morris helps you transform variables and operators into bouncing raindrops, brilliant colors, and dancing interface components. Below the chrome, you'll master techniques to make your applications more responsive and user friendly. You'll also learn how to interact with your existing Java code so you can give your old apps some new JavaFX sparkle.",

Sass and Compass extend standard CSS to give you more flexibility and the option to simplify or automate many tedious tasks. Think of Sass and Compass as power tools that allow stylesheet authors to \"paint\" with remarkable speed and precision.    Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding language features for creating well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Compass is a framework that sits atop Sass and tackles common stylesheet problems such as gid layouts, handling CSS3 vendor differences, and production environment stylesheet optimization. Together, they do for CSS what jQuery has done for JavaScript: solve real world problems, letting designers and developers create stylesheets more efficiently.

ASP.NET MVC is a development framework designed around these principles.

And since it's built from the ground up as a core part of the .NET framework, it integrates seamlessly with the ASP.NET features, such as Web Forms or Master Pages, that you already use.

      "longDescription": "Windows has an easy-to-use interface, but if you want to automate it, life can get hard. That is, unless you use PowerShell, an elegant new dynamic language from Microsoft designed as an all-purpose Windows scripting tool. PowerShell lets you script administrative tasks and control Windows from the command line. Because it was specifically developed for Windows, programmers and power-users can now do things in a shell that previously required VB, VBScript, or C#.    Windows PowerShell in Action was written by Bruce Payette, one of the founding members of the Windows PowerShell team, co-designer of the PowerShell language and the principal author of the PowerShell language implementation. From him you will gain a deep understanding of the language and how best to use it, and you'll love his insights into why PowerShell works the way it does.    This book is a tutorial for sysadmins and developers introducing the PowerShell language and its environment. It shows you how to build scripts and utilities to automate system tasks or create powerful system management tools to handle the day-to-day tasks that drive a Windows administrator's life. It's rich in interesting examples that will spark your imagination. The book covers batch scripting and string processing, COM, WMI, and even .NET and WinForms programming.",

A CRM application must know about the order history of a customer, but that history is stored in the sales application. A technology that companies increasingly use to integrate enterprise applications is the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).    Open-Source ESBs in Action describes how to use ESBs in real-world situations. You will learn how the various features of an ESB such as transformation, routing, security, connectivity, and more can be implemented on the example of two open-source ESB implementations: Mule and ServiceMix. The authors first introduce ServiceMix and Mule, and then present general principles and patterns of ESB use, as well as a structured approach to solving common integration problems, through examples using them.    Working in integration projects is exciting, with new technologies and paradigms arriving every day. In this area, open source is playing a more and more dominant role with projects such as Mule and ServiceMix. Open-Source ESBs in Action will help you to learn open-source integration technologies quickly and will proide you with knowledge that you can use to effectively work with Mule and ServiceMix.",

It offers productivity gains and useful features for any programmer, and is quickly gaining in popularity as a result. The only published source for the wxPython toolkit, co-authored by the toolkit s developer Robin Dunn, wxPython in Action shows readers why wxPython is a better interface tool than Tkinter, the tool that is distributed with Python.    Because they are often large and complex, GUI programming toolkits can be hard to use. wxPython is a combination of the Python programming language and the wxidgets toolkit, which allows programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. wxPython combines the power of an exceptionally complete user interface toolkit with an exceptionally flexible programming language. The result is a toolkit that is unique in the ease with which complex applications can be built and maintained.    wxPython in Action is a complete gide to the wxPython toolkit, containing a tutorial for getting started, a gide to best practices, and a reference to wxPython s extensive idget set. After an easy introduction to wxPython concepts and programming practices, the book takes an in-depth tour of when and how to use the bountiful collection of idgets offered by wxPython. All features are illustrated with useful code examples and reference tables are included for handy lookup of an object s properties, methods, and events. The book enables developers to learn wxPython quickly and remains a valuable resource for future work.",

      "longDescription": "Clojure is a modern implementation of Lisp for the JVM,ideally suited for general programming and specialized tasks like creating domain specific languages. Like Haskell and Scala, Clojure supports the functional style of programming. By combining first-class functions, lexical closures, multimethods, and a full-fledged macro system, you get more than what typical OO languages can possibly offer. Moreover, you get ultra-clean code that reflects Lisp's famously-concise style. That means far fewer bugs when compared to stateful languages such as Java or C++.

Blow through the theory and dive into practical matters like unit-testing, environment set up, all the way through building a scalable web-application using domain-specific languages, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.    For readers coming from Java, you'll see how Clojure's use of the JVM makes it seamlessly interoperable with existing Java code. Learn how to access the thousands of existing libraries and frameworks. You'll also discover the concurrency semantics built into the language, which enable you to very easily write multi-threaded programs and take advantage of multiple cores in modern CPUs.

      "longDescription": "Working With Objects is the authoritative account of the highly successful OOram method for software analysis, design, development, maintenance and reuse. OOram has been fine-tuned over a decade on hundreds of projects by Trygve Reenskaug and his collaborators. It is supported by available CASE tools, training, and consulting.    Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them. Theseideas form the heart of the OOram approach.    In a presentation rich with examples, Working With Objects is anything but the typical, dry methodology book. It tells real-life stories. It teaches how to apply role modeling and benefit from its inherent advantages, including:    Multiple views of the same model  Support for both data- and process-centered approaches  Large systems described through a number of distinct models  Derivation of composite models from simpler, base models  Decentralized management of very large systems  Programming language-independent design  Step-by-step transformation of models into implementations  Integration of powerful reuse techniques with work policies, processes and organization",

This book proides architectural gidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this bookidentifies the major SOA pressure points and proides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic Problem/Solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.    SOA Patterns shows you how to address common SOA concerns, including the areas of performance, availability, scalability, security, management, service interaction, user interface interaction, and service aggregation. The SOA anti-patterns part shows you how to avid common mistakes and how to refactor broken systems. The book also maps quality attributes to patterns so that you can easily find the patterns relevant to your problems.    WHAT'S INidE:        * Details more than 30 patterns for common SOA scenarios in the areas of security, performace, availability, UI integration, service aggregation and service interaction      * Describes more than 20 SOA pitfalls to avid      * Spotlights the architecural perspective on SOA      * Explains technology mapping from conceptual solution to current technologies      * Proides extensive and practical advice on matching patterns to technologies  ",

Applied well, it enables programmers to successfully deal with complexity in software and add new features to existing apps with greater ease. DI is the key to writing modular software and producing flexible and maintainable code bases.    While well-known among Java developers and other practitioners of object-oriented design, DI is only now gaining momentum in the .NET community. The Unity container released by Microsoft patterns & practices and the new Microsoft Extensibility Framework (MEF) make DI more relevant than ever for .NET developers.    Dependency Injection in .NET is a comprehensive gide than introduces DI and proides an in-depth look at applying DI practices to .NET apps.

Its much-improved replacement, C++/CLI, now proides an effective bidge between the native and managed programming worlds. Using this technology, developers can combine existing C++ programs and .NET applications with little or no refactoring. Accessing .NET libraries like Windows Forms, WPF, and WCF from standard C++ is equally easy.    C++/CLI in Action is a practical gide that will help you breathe new life into your legacy C++ programs. The book begins with a concise C++/CLI tutorial. It then quickly moves to the key themes of native/managed code interop and mixed-mode programming. You   ll learn to take advantage of GUI frameworks like Windows Forms and WPF while keeping your native C++ business logic. The book also covers methods for accessing C# or VB.NET components and libraries. Written for readers with a working knowledge of C++.",

Eric Siber, Developpez.com",
      "longDescription": "Agile principles have been a breath of fresh air to many development teams stuck in the iddle of a riid, process-driven environment. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn't a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.",

With the basics well in hand, you move into interesting examples of ActiveMQ at work, following a running Stock Portfolio application. You'll integrate ActiveMQ with containers like Geronimo and JBoss and learn to tie into popular Java-based technologies like Spring Framework.    Along the way, you'll pick up best practices forged out of the deep experience the authors bring to the book. You'll learn to integrate with non-Java technologies and explore advanced topics like broker topologies and configuration and performance tuning.

      "longDescription": "It is a well-known fact that most software projects fail. Drawing important lessons from common failures is the goal of Bitter Java.    Reusing design patterns is not enough for success: patterns are like partial maps of dangerous terrain. They help, but don't prevent you from getting lost. Bitter Java teaches you how to recognize when you are lost, and how to get back on the right path. It illustrates common pitfalls of Java programming through code examples; it then refactors the code and explains why the new solutions are safe.    This book is a systematic account of common server-ide Java programming mistakes, their causes and solutions. It covers antipatterns for base Java and J2EE concepts such as Servlets, JSPs, EJBs, enterprise connection models, and scalability. If you are an intermediate Java programmer, analyst or architect eager to avid the bitter experiences of others, this book is for you.",

      "longDescription": "In Bitter EJB, Bruce Tate and his co-authors continue the entertaining and engaging writing style of relating true-life adventure sport experiences to antipattern themes established in Bruce's first book, the best selling Bitter Java.    This more advanced book explores antipatterns, or common traps, within the context of EJB technology.    EJB is experiencing the mixture of practical success and controversy that accompanies a new and quickly-changing framework. Bitter EJB takes the swirling EJB controversies head-on. It offers a practical approach to design: how to become a better programmer by studying problems and solutions to the most important problems surrounding the technology.    The flip ide of design patterns, antipatterns, are a fun and interesting way to take EJB expertise to the next level. The book covers many different aspects of EJB, from transactions to persistence to messaging, as well as performance and testing.    Bitter EJB will teach programmers to do the following:   identify EJB persistence strategies  Choose Entity bean alternatives  Use EJB message driven beans  Know when to apply or avid stateful session beans  Create efficient build strategies with XDoclet, Ant and JUnit  Automate performance tuning",

      "longDescription": "For enterprise Java developers, Spring Framework proides remarkable improvements in developer productivity, runtime performance, and overall application quality. Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a ide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That's where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \"the Spring way\" by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You're never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don't have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book diides into three main parts. In Part 1, you'll get a raid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you're new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 proides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you're building. You'll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 proides domain-specific recipes. Here, you'll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE. Prior exposure to Spring Framework is helpful, but not required.",

      "longDescription": "It seems like we're all being asked to multi-task more than ever   and our computers are no exception to this trend. Multiple processors with multiple cores running multiple threads is quickly becoming the norm. C++ developers will have to master the principles, techniques, and new language features supporting concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.    With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way. There is a new memory model with support for multiple threads, along with a new multi-threading support library featuring low-level atomic operations, as well as basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. TR2 will proide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.    C++ Concurrency in Action is the first book to show you how to take advantage of the new C++ Standard and TR2 to write robust multi-threaded applications in C++.    As a gide and reference to the new concurrency features in the upcoming C++ Standard and TR, this book is invaluable for existing programmers familiar with writing multi-threaded code in C++ using platform-specific APIs, or in other languages, as well as C++ programmers who have never written multi-threaded code before.    If you're a programmer accustomed to writing single-threaded applications, C++ Concurrency in Action will show you how to write your new parallel algorithm in C++. You'll learn to avid many of the pitfalls associated with writing multi-threaded applications. You can also use this book to quickly transfer your platform-specific knowledge to the new Standard C++ threading library, enabling you to use a single API on both systems and simplify your code.",

A new species is evolving to take their place, one which is lean, fast, portable, and easy to maintain: Java servlets.    Servlets are not merely an alternative to CGI, for they can do much more. Servlets have opened the door to a world of client/server applications that would have been too difficult or too time-consuming to conider before.    Java Servlets: By Example takes the reader into the world of servlets, moving example by example from the simple to the complex. An early chapter explains the simple HTML form processing through servlets. A later chapter shows how to connect a Java applet to a servlet, which is itself connected to a database.    Java Servlets: By Example is full of real-world, ready-to-run example code. Each chapter deals with a new problem and takes the reader through a series of servlet-based solutions. However, the book is detailed enough that it may also serve as a reference for the developer.",

Then you'll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.\n\nWith the basics under your belt, you're ready to start building serious web applications using Node's HTTP API. You'll explore data storage, application deployment, and output templating, and you'll discover community frameworks that make web development easier and faster. Along the way, you'll learn to interact with the filesystem and to create non-HTTP applications, such as TCP/IP servers and command-line tools.\n\nMuch of the Node ecosystem is open source, so this book will show you how the community works and how you can contribute. You'll learn about the NPM Repository, where most community extensions reide, and you'll learn how to publish your own extensions.

      "longDescription": "XSLT Quickly is, quite obviously, for anyone who needs to learn XSLT quickly. This book has two main goals: to familiarize the reader with the portions of XSLT that he/she will use eighty per cent of the time, and to proide a \"cookbook\" approach to learning additional techniques as they are needed.    Part One is a step-by-step tutorial that brings the reader up to speed on the basic concepts and document manipulation techniques necessary for the most common XSLT tasks. More importantly, it represents the foundation on which the understanding of everything in Part Two is built.    Part Two is a cookbook--a task-oriented user's gide to various issues one may meet in tackling XSLT. This portion of the book is organized by the goals of XSLT tasks (converting elements to attributes, reading in multiple documents at once, etc.). This makes it far easier for readers who don't already know XSLT to quickly find the solutions to their stylesheet development problems.    XSLT Quickly also includes a glossary, a quick reference section for XSLT syntax, and a quick reference for using the popular XSLT processors.",

      "longDescription": "When you look carefully, you notice patterns connecting the events that occur in any system. Some events have obvious and immediate relationships. Other patterns are more complex or develop over a longer time. Event Processing is the ability toidentify and react to events and event patterns as they occur.    Event Processing in Action is a ground-breaking book that introduces the major concepts of event driven architectures and shows you how to use, design, and build event processing systems and applications. The book looks at practical examples and proides an in-depth explanation of their architecture and implementation. Throughout the book, you'll follow a comprehensive use case that expert authors Opher Etzion and Peter Niblett construct step-by-step.    Complex Event Processing, or CEP, is an emerging discipline, as well as an emerging market, which in 2008 is estimated in  150M and is expected to cross the  1B mark in 2-3 years. According to analysts' surveys, many businesses are starting to investigate both technical and business value coniderations of implementing event processing into their organizations.    Event Processing in Action will answer key questions like:        * What are event driven architectures and how do they fit enterprise applications       * What are the various uses of event processing       * What are its major concepts       * What is the life-cycle of event driven application, and how should building such an application be approached     As the story unfolds through the construction of an event-driven application, readers will see how a specification in a graphical notation grows into a working example. Programming examples will be based on a set of building blocks developed in the book; existing commercial products and open source alternatives will be surveyed.    This book is intended for software architects and developers who want to understand the principles behind the emerging discipline of event processing, and go deeper to the details.",

The soon-to-be-released Visual Studio 2008 proides the full set of developer tools you need to take advantage of this exciting technology.    The combination of WPF and Visual Studio 2008 represents the start of the next generation of Windows applications. Hand-coding XAML is fine if you're an early adopter, but to put WPF into production, you need to master the tools and application styles you'll use in your day job.    WPF in Action with Visual Studio 2008 focuses on WPF development using Visual Studio 2008 and other available tools. The book starts with thorough coverage of the basics, layouts, styles, resources, and themes. It then takes you through several real-world scenarios, exploring common challenges and application-types. You'll build several sample applications, ranging from a simple calculator to a typical line-of-business application.

It combines the nice features of a scripting language with the powerful features of a production environment   features like persistent data structures and clean multithreading that you'll need for industrial-strength application development.    The Joy of Clojure goes beyond just syntax to show you how to write fluent andidiomatic Clojure code. You'll learn a functional approach to programming and will master Lisp techniques that make Clojure so elegant and efficient. The book gives you easy access to hard soft ware areas like concurrency, interoperability, and performance. And it shows you how great it can be to think about problems the Clojure way.",

      "longDescription": "This comprehensive gide proides developers with the necessary skills to develop WAP applications and build dynamic Web sites for wireless use. Dynamic WAP Application Development first introduces the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and offers an in-depth explanation of the prominent wireless languages.    The authors begin with HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language), the first wireless language and one still supported by many Internet-enabled phones in the United States. They next cover WML (Wireless Markup Language), the XML-based successor to HDML that is supported by most phones worldide. The third language described is WMLScript, the client-ide scripting language of the wireless world that enables the developer to include procedure logic within their WML markup. In addition to hands-on practice with each of these languages, the book examines the issues involved in wireless application design and in converting HDML documents into WML.    The book also proides an overview of Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) and Java Servlets, and gides developers through the process of creating dynamic WAP applications using these server-ide technologies.    Application design specific to the small display and limited memory capacity of wireless phones is also covered. Advanced topics include security, performance, and the intricacies of WAP gateways. The book also includes robust case studies that put WAP concepts into practice.    This book is geared for developers who are called upon to extend existing Web services to wireless phone subscribers and for those who need to understand the resources involved in the development and deployment of WAP applications.",

      "longDescription": "In 2005, Microsoft quietly announced an initiative to bring dynamic languages to the .NET platform. The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework.    IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-ide web programming.    IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and    duck typing   , metaprogramming, and more.    IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors proide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more.    Whether you're a Python user exploring .NET or a .NET developer exploring the world of dynamic languages, IronPython in Action will get you started quickly and show you how to be productive with this powerful new tool.",

Beginning with coverage of the history of the architecture of web applications, highlighting the uses of the standard web API to create applications with increasingly sophisticated architectures, developers are led through a discussion on the development of industry accepted best practices for architecture.    Described is the history and evolution towards this architecture and the reasons that it is superior to previous efforts. Also proided is an overview of the most popular web application frameworks, covering their architecture and use. Numerous frameworks exist, but trying to evaluate them is difficult because their documentation stresses their advantages but ides their deficiencies. Here, the same application is built in six different frameworks, proiding a way to perform an informed comparison. Also proided is an evaluation of the pros and cons of each framework to assist in making a decision or evaluating a framework on your own. Finally, best practices are covered, including sophisticated user interface techniques, intelligent caching and resource management, performance tuning, debugging, testing, and Web services.",

But \"simple\" can be deceiving: you have to make many changes, in locations which can be difficult to find.    If this sounds familiar, you want to know about Java reflection. With reflection, you can work smarter by designing flexible applications to which you can easily add likely new requirements. Then, with a few code changes in easy-to-find places, you've got the job done. Reflection adds a new dimension to your programming skills. It will boost your effectiveness.    Java Reflection in Action starts from the basics. It gradually builds a complete understanding, adding as it goes reflective concepts illustrated with many small examples that are useful in real applications.    In a subplot, the book follows a programmer, George, as he tackles common but difficult tasks. In each case, George finds flexible, reflective solutions that replace the usual hard-coded ones. The power of reflection becomes clear through his story.",

      "longDescription": "On any given day, a developer may encounter a system rife with languages, frameworks, and operating environments   none of which resemble the actual domain of the system he's being asked to develop! Success   and sanity   dictate that developers and designers work at higher levels of abstraction so that they can remain focused on the problems they're trying to solve. Domain Specific Languages, \"little languages\" implemented on top of a conventional programming language, proide a way to maintain the power of the underlying network of technology while writing code that more closely models the domain of the business problem.    DSLs in Action introduces the concepts and definitions a developer needs to build high-quality domain specific languages. It proides a soid foundation to the usage as well as implementation aspects of a DSL, focusing on the necessity of applications speaking the language of the domain. After reading this book, a programmer will be able to design APIs that make better domain models. For experienced developers, the book addresses the intricacies of domain language design without the pain of writing parsers by hand.    The gap in understanding between the development team and the business domain specialists can lead to errors during user acceptance tests. This book teaches developers to build DSLs that bidge this gap by offering API development techniques that closely model the domain vocabulary. Even non-programmer domain experts can benefit from this book by learning how DSLs can make them a more integral part of the team during the program development phase.    The book discusses DSL usage and implementations in the real world based on a suite of JVM languages like Java, Ruby, Scala, and Groovy. It contains code snippets that implement real world DSL designs and discusses the pros and cons of each implementation.    WHAT'S INidE        * Working with DSLs in real-life applications      * In-depth techniques of DSL implementation      * Meta-programming techniques      * Parser/Combinator based little languages      * Implementing DSLs on top of the JVM      * Real-world DSL examples      * Interoperability among JVM languages      * Correct level of abstraction for your domain APIs      * DSL and Domain Driven Design    This book is written especially for developers familiar with JVM-based languages, but many of the techniques presented will work in other programming environments as well.",
